They have several applications already in production but they have are facing some problems lately when it comes to manage feedbacks and other insights about its projects and have a proper way to track progress how these feedbacks or suggestions are being done within these projects.

PPM is an out-sourcing company that creates bespoke applications according to some specifications the client is requiring. After multiple meetings and brainstorm sessions they came up with a name which is **Team-tool**, this would be the final product used to track every single projects' feedbacks or suggestions in the company.

A **Project** is a work to be done that potentially will become into a final product. A project has an owner that typically is a **User** but with some privileges to read and write the state of the project where he is owner of. Some of those privileges are assigning Users to a Project and so having the ability to create **Boards**, a board is a workspace with a common goal where multiple members (also Users) can add suggestions or feedbacks about the product. A board can have a **Road Map** where we can see a better insight of the current project tracking. Users assigned to a board can add as much as many feedbacks or suggestions, within every ticket feedback is also possible to write **Comments** about and vote for a feedback that does make much sense so this can be addressed as soon as possible.
